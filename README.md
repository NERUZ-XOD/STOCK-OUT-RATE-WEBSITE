# Stock Out Rate Calculator

## Overview
The Stock Out Rate Calculator is a web-based tool designed to assist users in calculating stock out rates for inventory management. It offers two primary functionalities:

- **Single-Day Stock Out Rate**: Computes the stock out rate for a single day based on the number of stock outs and total demand.
- **Average Stock Out Rate**: Calculates the average stock out rate over a selected month by entering daily rates.

This README focuses on the HTML structure of the website, which forms the foundation of the user interface. The project includes a CSS file for styling but currently lacks a JavaScript file for interactivity. Adding JavaScript is essential to enable the calculatorâ€™s full functionality.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for entering stock out data.
- Option to calculate either a single-day stock out rate or an average rate over a month (when JavaScript is added).
- Displays results and maintains a calculation history for single-day rates (with JavaScript).
- Includes a navigation bar, calculator sections, and a footer with social links.
- Styled with a CSS file for a dark-themed, modern appearance.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the website structure.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the website (included in your project).
- `script.js`: Not currently included, but required for interactivity (see "Adding JavaScript" section below).
